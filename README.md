### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Garrett Bland, a Full Stack Web Developer with Eagle Communications in Hays, Kansas. I manage our local news sites, as well as create client websites. I develop heavily in Javascript & Node, with an emphasis on React.

I'm an inspiring entreprenuer and love jumping into new things and learning. I've created a handful of projects and am currently working on a few new ones, and write about development from time to time.

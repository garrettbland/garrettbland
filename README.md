### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Garrett Bland, a Lead Principal Javascipt Engineer with [Ally Bank](https://www.ally.com/). I develop heavily in React & Typescript, as well as lead a UI team that delivers awesome products across multiple lines of business in the financial industry. We focus primarily on web and mobile projects using React, Typescript, Node, and React Native.

I'm an inspiring entreprenuer and love jumping into new things and learning.
I've created a handful of projects using various technologies, and always try
to do uncomfortable things to help grow as a developer and a human.

Lately I've been getting my hands messy with the new OpenAI technology, 
decentralized authentication with web3, and have been doing a lot more
Swift. (The Swift bit is for getting back into mobile development ðŸ‘€)
